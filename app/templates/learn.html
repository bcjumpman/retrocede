  <h2>What is a Stock? ðŸ¤”</h2>
  <p>
    A <strong>stock</strong> is like a tiny piece of a company. When you own a
    stock, you own a part of that company! If the company does well, your stock
    can become more valuable.
  </p>

  <h2>How Can I Buy Stocks? ðŸ›’</h2>
  <p>
    You can use pretend money to buy pieces of a company (called shares). For
    example, if one share costs $10 and you buy 2 shares, you spend $20.
  </p>

  <h2>What Happens When I Sell Stocks? ðŸ’°</h2>
  <p>
    If the company grows and your stock becomes more valuable, you can sell it
    for more money than you bought it for. That's how you "earn" pretend money!
  </p>

  <h2>Fun Fact ðŸŽ‰</h2>
  <p>
    Some companies you know, like Disney, McDonald's, and Lego, are also on the
    stock market! You can own part of them.
